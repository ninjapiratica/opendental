# This is an exploratory fork to play around with. Code from 22_4 has been merged into main where the main repo doesn't have these files

# Open Dental
**REQUIREMENT:** You must first install the [Trial Version](https://www.opendental.com/trial.html) so you can see the files involved in the installation process. This is the *ONLY* way to get the initial database tables installed. Then you can later attempt to compile the source code files.

* See [Programming Resources](https://www.opendental.com/site/programmingresources.html) for database documentation.
* See [Previous Versions](https://opendentalsoft.com:1943/ODBugTracker/PreviousVersions.aspx) for changes have been made since the last version. 
* See [Subversion (SVN)](https://opendentalsoft.com:23793/svn/opendental) for old source code versions before 2022.

## Getting Started
Each branch contains all of the corresponding releases for said Major and Minor version and each commit the branches will contain the code for each Major, Minor, and Build version.

For example, if you want to use the most recent code for Open Dental v21.4 you would simply checkout branch `21_4` and the most recent build of v21.4 would be used. Checkout a specific commit within the corresponding branch when a specific build is desired. Each commit will have a commit message like **version 21.4.14.0** so checkout that commit when v21.4.14 is the desired Major, Minor, and Build.

## Build
The Open Dental solution does not build out of the box.\
See [Source Code](https://www.opendental.com/site/sourcecode.html) for getting Open Dental to build.  
We do not accept outside code contributions. See [Programming Assistance](https://www.opendental.com/site/programmingassistance.html)
