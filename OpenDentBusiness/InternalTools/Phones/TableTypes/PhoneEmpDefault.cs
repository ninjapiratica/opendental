//2020-09-24-This table was causing slowness issues.  PhoneEmpDefaults.Refresh was being called from all workstations every 1.6 seconds.
//If I did my math right (10hrs x 60min x 60sec /1.6sec x 250comps), that's something like 5.6 million queries per day just for this one table.
//I verified that none of the fields are set very often except StatusOverride.
//I'm going to assume StatusOverride and IsGraphed are set about 300 times per day, or about once every two minutes.
//A standard cache pattern would, therefore, reduce traffic by a factor of 75, getting us down to 75k queries per day.
//A more elegant pattern for later would be to move IsGraphed and StatusOverride out to another table so that PhoneEmpDefault only changes as new employees are added.
//The only table that should be getting hit every 1.6 seconds should be the phone table, and we are a long way from that ideal.
