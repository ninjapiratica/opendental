    //This is a MediaFoundation wrapper. 
    //It was based on the Tanta Project, which was written to demonstrate how to use MF
    //Documentation: http://www.ofitselfso.com/Tanta/Windows_Media_Foundation_Getting_Started_CSharp.pdf
    //Code: https://github.com/OfItselfSo/Tanta
    //I copied part of the Tanta code called CaptureToScreenAndFile.
    //Notes for that are on my hard drive at E:\Documents\Open Dental\PROGRAMMING\2020-10-31-Video Capture
    //I then spent 2 days refactoring and simplifying to create what I call VideoCamLib.dll.
    //The source code for VideoCamLib.dll and the testing environment was copied to in My\Jordan\VideoCameraTesting.
    //The C# code from that test environment was then copied to OD proper and further simplified.
    //There is another earlier attempt at MF found in the abandoned project at Versioned\OpenDentalImaging. I would ignore that one.
    //This code far from perfect, but the foundation is in place.
    //The plan is to overhaul the C++ and C# code with good organization and comments, and to actually understand what it's doing instead of just blindly copying.
    //It should be possible since I already understand COM, which is the source of much of the complexity.
    //I think we need to add support for higher resolution cameras and support the capture button pin on the camera.
    //To test, I will need to get a higher resolution camera.
    //These issues are both addressed by code from James Petko at Digital Doc.
    //https://github.com/JimPetko/HighResVideoCaptureSample
    //His code uses SharpDX for the game controller for capture button. This could be done directly with C++ instead, once I inspect what he did.
